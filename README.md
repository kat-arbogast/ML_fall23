This contains all of the code and data used to create the semester long machine learning project. This project will focus on wildfires in the United States. 


## Introduction

Wildfires represent a formidable natural disaster, instilling fear due to their capacity to wreak havoc. These infernos possess the destructive potential to obliterate homes, devastate ecosystems, ravage agricultural lands, and tragically claim lives. Consequently, it is imperative for communities to invest in a comprehensive understanding of wildfires and enhance their predictive capabilities to safeguard both their residents and the surrounding environment. Regrettably, in recent decades, wildfires have surged in severity, unleashing unprecedented devastation upon our landscapes, properties, and human lives. To address this escalating crisis, proactive measures must be taken to delve into the different factors that influence wildfire dynamics, discerning how human activities and natural phenomena interact to either worsen or mitigate the crisis. The core objective of this project is to analyze trends and construct models that highlight and understand the intricacies of external factors, such as weather patterns and human interventions, on the escalating severity of wildfires. Hopefully these efforts will create valuable insights to then then develop effective strategies for wildfire prevention and response.

Current efforts made in this area of focus tend to be largely government agencies as this impacts the US as a whole, and also it requires ample research and funding. For example one of the largest databases and analytics groups for wildfires in the United States is the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with their National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS), which is accessible to the public here. Another important group to mention is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association - National Centers for Environmental Information where one can find summary information from the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). These groups are collecting and providing current and historic information on fire incidents. Not only are these organizations impactful in the work they do researching and reporting information on wildfires, they also are multifaceted and help the community gain knowledge about a variety of natural disasters. This machine learning project aims to learn and grow from the current work, and attempt to pull in other resources such as the US drought monitoring data (which is produced through a partnership between the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the United States Department of Agriculture and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) to develop strong understanding and models for the wildfires in the Unites States. 

## Focused Topic Questions

1. How has the severity of US fires changed over time?

2. Is there a "fire season" like people say? 

3. How might seasonal changes within a year impact fires and their severity?

4. How may human intervention have improved or worsened wildfires in the US?

5. What are the most common human based causes for fires?

6. What are the most common environmental cause for fires?

7. How have climate changes impacted wildfires and their severity? 

8. How effective can different models be in predicting a future year's fire statistics? 

9. What are people's sentiments around wildfires and other climate issues?

10. In terms of severity, how has fires changed in both environmental damage and human life impacts (and why might they differ)?
